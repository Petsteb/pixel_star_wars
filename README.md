One day coding adventure.

This is my first game made in python, at the start of 2023.

It uses concepts from obejct oriented programing and all the assets are generated with ai (midjourney).

I made it with lots of space for improvement. Maybe one day I will come back to this project...

To play the game download the "main" folder and run "mai.exe".

In thi game you have to destroy all the enemies within 10 seconds per level.

To move use the left and right arrows or the 'a' and 'd' keys.

To shoot press 'space'.

The more enemies you destroy, the better your gun gets.

Warning! The bullets have inertia!
